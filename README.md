# Tauri 2.0 + TanStack Start Solid Template

This is a [Tauri 2.0](https://v2.tauri.app/) project template using [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest),
bootstrapped by combining [`create @tanstack/start`](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/solid/quick-start)
and [`create tauri-app`](https://v2.tauri.app/start/create-project/).

This template uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) as the Node.js dependency
manager, and uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) with type-safe file-based routing.

## Template Features

- TypeScript frontend using [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest) with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) with type-safe file-based routing
- [TailwindCSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a utility-first atomic CSS framework
  - While not included by default, consider using
    [Kobalte](https://kobalte.dev/) and/or [corvu](https://corvu.dev/) for
    completely unstyled and fully accessible UI components, which integrate
    nicely with TailwindCSS
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing with [Solid Testing Library](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-testing-library)
- Opinionated formatting and linting already setup and enabled
  - [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for fast formatting, linting, and import sorting of TypeScript code
  - [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and
    [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) for Rust code
- GitHub Actions to check code formatting and linting for both TypeScript and Rust

## Getting Started

### Running development server and use Tauri window

After cloning for the first time, change your app identifier inside
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to your own:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  // The default "com.tauri.dev" will prevent you from building in release mode
  "identifier": "com.my-application-name.app",
  // ...
}
```

To develop and run the frontend in a Tauri window:

```shell
pnpm tauri dev
```

This will load the TanStack Start frontend directly in a Tauri webview window, in addition to
starting a development server on `localhost:3000`.
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> in a Chromium based WebView (e.g. on
Windows) to open the web developer console from the Tauri window.

### Building for release

To build the TanStack Start frontend and the Tauri application for release:

```shell
pnpm tauri build
```

### Running tests

```shell
pnpm test
```

### Source structure

TanStack Start frontend source files are located in `src/` and Tauri Rust application source
files are located in `src-tauri/`. Please consult the TanStack Start and Tauri documentation
respectively for questions pertaining to either technology.

## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing.
Routes are managed as files in `src/routes/`.

### Adding a Route

To add a new route, create a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.
TanStack Router will automatically generate the route configuration.

### Adding Links

Use the `Link` component from `@tanstack/solid-router` for SPA navigation:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/solid-router";

<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

### Using a Layout

The root layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Content added to the root route
will appear in all routes. Use the `<Outlet />` component to render child routes.

More information on layouts can be found in the
[TanStack Router Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/outlets).

## Prerendering

TanStack Start uses prerendering to generate static HTML files at build time. This is essential for Tauri since:

1. **Tauri serves static files** - Tauri loads your frontend from the local filesystem, not from a running server
2. **No Node.js runtime** - Unlike a traditional web app, there's no backend server to handle SSR at runtime
3. **Instant loading** - Prerendered HTML loads immediately without waiting for JavaScript to hydrate

### Prerender Modes

The template supports two prerendering modes, controlled by the `USE_SSR_PRERENDER_MODE` environment variable in [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts):

| Mode              | Env Variable           | Behavior                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SPA (default)** | unset, `false`, or `0` | Outputs a single `/index.html` with client-side routing to handle SPA navigation |
| **SSR Prerender** | `true` or `1`          | Crawls links and tries to generate an HTML file per route                        |

To enable SSR prerendering instead, set the environment variable before building:

```shell
USE_SSR_PRERENDER_MODE=true pnpm tauri build
```

For most Tauri apps, the default SPA mode is sufficient and simpler. Use the SSR prerendering mode if you also expect your app to be deployed as a website to allow for improved SEO on a per-route basis.

## Caveats

### `TypeError: can't access property "invoke", window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__ is undefined`

This error occurs when Tauri APIs (like `invoke`) are called outside of Tauri's webview context. When Tauri launches your app, it runs your frontend inside a native webview (WebView2 on Windows, WebKit on macOS/Linux). During initialization, Tauri injects a `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` object into the webview's global `window` variable. This object contains the IPC bridge that enables communication between your frontend and the Rust backend (including the `invoke` function).

You may encounter this error if you:

- Open the dev server URL directly in a standalone browser
- Import Tauri APIs at the module level during SSR/prerendering (Node.js context)
- Run code that accesses Tauri APIs before the webview has fully initialized

For Tauri apps, always try to develop via Tauri's webview instead of opening the URL in a browser directly. Additionally, guarded Tauri API calls or dynamic imports can be used in the frontend code to avoid this issue in SSR contexts.
